# Module 3: Loops

## What are Loops?
* Loops are a sequence of instructions that are continually repeated until a certain condition is reached. We can use loops to repeat an instruction multiple times!

## Types of Loops:
1. For Loop
2. While Loop

## Making your own Loops!

Let's make a while loop:

Let's make a for loop:

## Loop Dangers!

**Infinite Loop**
An Infinite Loop is a continuous repetitive conditional loop that gets executed *forever*. Now an infinite loop will not necessarily run forever, it will eventually end when the computer runs out of memory. However, this is something you should avoid becuase your program will hang. 

You can end up in an infinite loop if you don't have a condition that is met in your loop. 

For example:

In the above image you can see the loop will never exit because *x* will never be less than *-2*

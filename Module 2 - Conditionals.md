# Module 2: Conditionals
## What are Conditionals? and Why?

* Conditionals are the code that makes your program run a different base in certain situations
* Without conditionals, one program can only do thing no matter what the actual situation is
* Without conditionals, program will fail and crash if it encounters a situation you hadn't thought of

## Let's Check Common Conditional Code in Python!
### Type of Conditions
- Equals: a == b, this will check if a equal to b, and return true or false base on each case
- Not Equals: a != b , this will check if a unequal to b, and return true or false base on each case
- Less than: a < b , this will check if a less than to b, and return true or false base on each case
- Less than or equal to: a <= b, this will check if less than or equal to b, and return true or false base on each case
- Greater than: a > b, this will check if a greater than b, and return true or false base on each case
- Greater than or equal to: a >= b, this will check if a greater than or equal to b, and return true or false base on each case

Those conditions can help you get true or false base on different situation, so code can react differently to that true or false and does different behavior. However, just having these conditions is not enough, let's learn another important python statement in next section ----**if/else** statement

## If and else?

            <h2>1. What is This Course?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>This is a beginner course for middle school students who want to gain basic CS Skills</li>

                <li>Computer Science (CS) is the study of different problems and the ways we can code to solve them. Although there are countless different languages, each with their own unique features and drawbacks, these basic concepts can be applied to almost all of them</li>

                <li>CS allows us to approach complex problems and break it down into smaller pieces that we can manage, this is an important skill you'll need to use in many parts of your day-to-day </li>

            </ul>

            <h2>2. What Resources Do I Need? </h2>

            <p>Follow along and learn while typing! We will be using a free online compiler called Programiz for all of our programs. Link: https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/</p>

            <h3>Handy Dandy Programiz Guide:</h3>
            <img src="images/programiz.png" alt="">
            <ul>
                <li>Programiz Notes:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Make sure Python is selected (top left).</li>

                    <li>We write our code in the left box. This is our miniature program file. When you click the "Run" button, the program outputs in the right box. Use the clear button to clear output.</li>

                    <li>If your program outputs an error, your code needs a fix. Common errors include: missing marks ( , : () # ), misspelled functions, and improper formatting</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Patience and time</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>You will need to read and understand the modules and code that we have provided</li>

                    <li>There will be a `Do It Yourself` challenge at the end of each module that we encourage students to complete on their own, without any notes</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. How Can I Make the Most of It? </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Move in small chunks
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Instead of running through this course in a single day, go by each module day by day or week by week </li>

                    <li>Make sure you're understanding the concepts and know how to apply them, rather than just copy and paste code</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Do the practice assignments</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Practicing is the only way to really perfect these concepts</li>
                    <li>If you run into errors, try to <b>debug</b> the code and understand what each line does</li>
                </ul>

                <li>Follow the resources</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>We've linked many different resources within each module to help you understand each piece correctly, use them whenever you need</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Break it down</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Nothing we present will be impossible since this course is carefully crafted for most beginner audiences with no prior experience</li>

                    <li>Break down complex concepts/ homework assignments into pieces that you understand and can attack individually</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Closing Notes </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>We're glad you chose this course to guide you through the basics of CS </li>

                <li>We hope that you're able to learn and apply these new concepts in all aspects of your educational and professional career</li>

                <li>Good luck! </li>

        <h1>Variables and Printing</h1>
            <h2>Choosing a Variable Name</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Only use alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )</li>

                <li>The name needs to start with a letter or underscore character</li>

                <li>Cannot start with a number</li>

                <li>Are case-sensitive (var, Var and VAR are three different variables)</li>

            </ul>
            <h3>Legal Variable Name Examples:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>myvar = “Sam”</li>
                <li>my_var = “Sam”</li>
                <li>my_var = “Sam”</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Illegal Variable Name Examples:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>7myvar = “Sam”</li>
                <li>my-var = “Sam”</li>
                <li>my var = “Sam”</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Variable Declaration</h2>
            <p>Python has no command for declaring a variable so datatype are automatically assigned</p>
            <ul>
                <li>x = 3 -> automatically assumed to be an int</li>
                <li>y = “Tom” -> automatically assumed to be a string</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>type() function</h3>
            <p>To check the data type assigned to your variable, use the type() function</p>
            <img src="images/checkDataType.png" alt="">
            
            <h2>Casting</h2>
            <p>To specify the data type of a variable, use casting</p>
            <ul>
                <li>x = str(3)  -> the integer is now turned into a string -> ‘3’</li>
                <li>y = int(‘3’)  -> the string is now turned into a integer -> 3</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="images/casting.png" alt="">

            <h2>Printing</h2>
            <p>print() function allows you to output variables <br> Components: print(object(s), sep=separator, end=end, file=file, flush=flush)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>x = "Python"</li>
                <li>y = "is"</li>
                <li>z = "awesome"</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Utilizing print systems: <br>
                Automatically assumed to use “ “ as separator</p>
            <img src="images/printStatement1.png" alt="">
            <p>Use a different separator(“—“)</p>
            <img src="images/printStatement2.png" alt="">
            <p> Can separate variables using “+” as well</p>
            <img src="images/printStatement3.png" alt="">
            <p>Carefully add separators when using “+”</p>
            <img src="images/printStatement4.png" alt="">

# Module 3: Loops

## What are Loops?
* Loops are a sequence of instructions that are continually repeated until a certain condition is reached. We can use loops to repeat an instruction multiple times!

## Types of Loops:
1. For Loop
* Take a look at https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html to see all of Python's built-in functions. Scroll down to see what they do!
2. While Loop

## Making your own Loops!

Let's make a while loop:

1. Every function in Python starts with __def__, followed by the __function name__, and __():__
* "Parameters" are optional inputs that the function uses and changes. Parameters go __inside__ the parentheses. (more on that later)
  * _def makeTable():_, _def greet(name):_, and _def add(num1, num2)_ are all valid first lines of a user-defined function.

2. Every function also contains a body
* This is where we actually complete the tasks

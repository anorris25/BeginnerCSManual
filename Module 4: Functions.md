# Module 4: Functions

## What are Functions?
* Functions are structures that allow us to complete a series of actions in our program. We use them to perform tasks!



## Types of Functions:
1. __Built-in functions:__ functions that Python provides for us like __print()__!
* Take a look at https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html to see all of Python's built-in functions. Scroll down to see what they do!
3. __User-defined functions:__ functions that programmers create to accomplish specific tasks in their program.

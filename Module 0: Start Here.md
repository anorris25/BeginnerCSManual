# Start Here
## 1. What is this course?
- This is a beginner course for middle school students who want to gain basic CS Skills

## 2. What resources do I need?
- Online Python Code Environment:
    - We will use `https://www.onlinegdb.com` to write and run our code
    - Our language of choice will be *python 3* but these concepts can be applied to any other language as well
- Patience and time
    - You will need to read and understand the modules and code that we have provided
    - There will be a `Do It Yourself` challenge at the end of each module that we encourage students to complete on their own, without any notes

## 3. How can I make the most of it?
- Move in small chunks
    - Instead of running through this course in a single day, go by each module day by day or week by week 
    - Make sure you're understanding the concepts and know how to apply them, rather than just copy and paste code
- Do the practice assignments
    - Practicing is the only way to really perfect these concepts
    - If you run into errors, try to **debug** the code and understand what each line does
- Follow the resources
    - We've linked many different resources within each module to help you understand each piece correctly, use them whenever you need
## 4. Closing notes
- We're glad you chose this course to guide you through the basics of CS 
- We hope that you're able to learn and apply these new concepts in all aspects of your educational and professional career
- Good luck!

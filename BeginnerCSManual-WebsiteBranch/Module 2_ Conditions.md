# Module 2: Conditions
## What are condition? and why?

* Condition are the code that makes your program does different base on 
    each situation
* Without condition, one program can only do thing no matter what the actual situation is
* Without condition, program will fail and crush if it encounters a situation you hadn't thought of

## Let's Check Common Condition Code in Python!
### Type of Conditions
- Equals: a == b, this will check if a equal to b, and return true or false base on each case
- Not Equals: a != b , this will check if a unequal to b, and return true or false base on each case
- Less than: a < b , this will check if a less than to b, and return true or false base on each case
- Less than or equal to: a <= b, this will check if less than or equal to b, and return true or false base on each case
- Greater than: a > b, this will check if a greater than b, and return true or false base on each case
- Greater than or equal to: a >= b, this will check if a greater than or equal to b, and return true or false base on each case
- Check out the following example.

Those conditions can help you get true or false base on different situation, so code can react differently to that true or false and does different behavior. However, just having these conditions is not enough, let's learn another important python statement in next section ----**if/else** statement

## If ,else and elif?
- if statement will check the true of false of its condition and decide which part should be run.
- elif will run its part of code when its condition statement turn to be true.
- else statement will run its code only when if statement and all the elif turn to false.

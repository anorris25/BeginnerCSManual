# Module 4: Functions

## What are Functions?
* Functions are structures that allow us to complete a series of actions in our program. We use them to perform tasks!

## Types of Functions:
1. __Built-in functions:__ functions that Python provides for us like __print()__!
* Take a look at https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html to see all of Python's built-in functions. Scroll down to see what they do!
3. __User-defined functions:__ functions that programmers create to accomplish specific tasks in their program.

## Making your own Functions!

Let's analyze our "do_something()" function from before:

1. Every function in Python starts with __def__, followed by the __function name__, and __():__
* "Parameters" are optional inputs that the function uses and changes. Parameters go __inside__ the parentheses. (more on that later)
  * _def makeTable():_, _def greet(name):_, and _def add(num1, num2)_ are all valid first lines of a user-defined function.

2. Every function also contains a body
* This is where we actually complete the tasks

# Start Here
## 1. What is this course?
- This is a beginner course for middle school students who want to gain basic CS Skills
- Computer Science (CS) is the study of different problems and the ways we can code to solve them. Although there are countless different languages, each with their own unique features and drawbacks, these basic concepts can be applied to almost all of them
- CS allows us to approach complex problems and break it down into smaller pieces that we can manage, this is an important skill you'll need to use in many parts of your day-to-day 


## 2. What resources do I need?
- Online Python Code Environment:
    - We will use [Online Compiler]([https://www.onlinegdb.com](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/)) to write and run our code
    - Our language of choice will be *python 3* but these concepts can be applied to any other language as well
- Patience and time
    - You will need to read and understand the modules and code that we have provided
    - There will be a `Do It Yourself` challenge at the end of each module that we encourage students to complete on their own, without any notes


## 3. How can I make the most of it?
- Move in small chunks
    - Instead of running through this course in a single day, go by each module day by day or week by week 
    - Make sure you're understanding the concepts and know how to apply them, rather than just copy and paste code
- Do the practice assignments
    - Practicing is the only way to really perfect these concepts
    - If you run into errors, try to **debug** the code and understand what each line does
- Follow the resources
    - We've linked many different resources within each module to help you understand each piece correctly, use them whenever you need
- Break it down
    - Nothing we present will be impossible since this course is carefully crafted for most beginner audiences with no prior experience
    - Break down complex concepts/ homework assignments into pieces that you understand and can attack individually


## 4. Closing notes
- We're glad you chose this course to guide you through the basics of CS 
- We hope that you're able to learn and apply these new concepts in all aspects of your educational and professional career
- Good luck!

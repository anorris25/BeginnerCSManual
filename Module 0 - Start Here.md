## 1. What is this manual?
- This manual serves as a beginner programming course for middle school students who want to gain basic CS skills.
- We learn Computer Science (CS) to understand how computation solves different problems. The concepts we introduce in this course are shown in the Python programming language. Different programming languages have their own unique features and drawbacks, but basic CS concepts apply to any of them.
- CS helps us approach complex problems, and break them down into smaller pieces that we can manage. This also acts as an important skill you'll need to use in many parts of your day-to-day life.


## 2. What resources do I need?

Follow along and learn while typing! We will be using a free online compiler called _Programiz_ for all of our programs. Link: https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/

### Programiz Notes:
* Make sure Python is selected (top left).
* We write our _code_ in the left box. This is our miniature program file. When you click the "Run" button, the program outputs in the right box. Use the clear button to clear output.
* If your program outputs an error, your code needs a fix. Common errors include: missing marks ( , : () # ), misspelled functions, and improper formatting
### You will need patience and time
- You will need to read and understand the modules and code that we have provided.
- There will be a `Test Your Knowledge` challenge in the 6th module which students are encouraged to complete on their own.


## 3. How can I make the most of it?
- Move in small chunks:
    - Instead of running through this course in a single day, go by each module day by day or week by week 
    - Make sure you're understanding the concepts and know how to apply them, rather than just copy and paste code
- Try the challenge assignments:
    - Practicing is the only way to really perfect these concepts
    - If you run into errors, try to **debug** the code and understand what each line does
- Follow the resources:
    - We've linked many different resources within each module to help you understand each piece correctly, use them when needed
- Break it down:
    - Nothing we present will be impossible since this course is carefully crafted for most beginner audiences with no prior experience
    - Break down complex concepts/ homework assignments into pieces that you understand and can attack individually


## 4. Closing notes
- We're glad you chose this course to guide you through the basics of CS 
- We hope that you're able to learn and apply these new concepts in all aspects of your educational and professional career
- Good luck!
